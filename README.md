# Objectives
This project is designed to test your ability to build complex servers and access data through a database. To succeed at this project, you’ll need to demonstrate that you can do the following tasks:
* Install and use common middleware packages
* Receive requests through routes
* Run tests from the command line
* Access relevant information through route and query parameters
* Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn’t exist
* Build an API following RESTful design principles
* Create and customize a knexfile.js file
* Create a connection to your database with Knex
* Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
* Return joined and nested data with Knex
* Write database migrations using Knex’s migration tool
* Deploy your backend server to a cloud service


# General tasks
You will also need to make sure that the following tasks are complete.
* Your app.js file and server.js file are correctly configured, with your app.js file exporting the application created from Express.
* You use the cors package so that requests from the frontend can correctly reach the backend.
* If a request is made to a route that doesn’t exist, the server returns a 404 error.
* If a request is made to a route that exists but the HTTP method is wrong, the server returns a 405 error.
* All of your routes respond with the appropriate status code and use a data key in the response.


# Project rubric

* All the tests are passing in Qualified.
* The migrations can be correctly run and rolled back.
* The seed command can be run multiple times and will work correctly.
